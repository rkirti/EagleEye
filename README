Project Status:
-------------------------
1. Circuit Parsing and Populating: With lex and yacc
2. Good Simulation,Fault Simulation, Random Vector: Simulations work, tested against
verilog simulator (iverilog). No proper random vector generation is done at the moment.
3. ATPG: Implications and checking them working. Rest of the algo not implemented as yet.

Folder Structure:
--------------------------
src     :  All the source files. ATPG functions currently put in circuit.cpp, need to be moved from there
parser  :  Lex and yacc files to parse the verilog input
include :  All headers
bin
obj

To Compile:

Use make. Makefile works.
Order:
make clean
make depend
make

To run:
./bin/atpg <any benchmark file>
(Can use any benchmark for simulation, for ATPG, only fanout free ckts have been tested)
