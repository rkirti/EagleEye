Status
================
Good simulation, random vector based fault-simulation
is handled robustly. ATPG works well for fanout free
and only in specific cases for fanout circuits.
Small circuits (see attached sample1.v and sample2.v)
have been tested on for ATPG and all benchmarks tested
for fault-simulation against iverilog's simulation.


TODO
===============================
* Add usage of STL class bitset to have systematic input/output
 vector representations rather than the current hard-coded stuff.

* Currently only one vector is returned per fault and no use is made 
  of the FaultSet structure in the circuit. Need to add code to run Do_ATPG
  multiple times to get all the test vectors. No fault collpasing done at the 
  moment.

* Use of level/SCOAP measures - choice of gates/inputs in Frontier handling
  is arbitrary at the moment.
